I couldn't find a model for the one cell itself. There were many small parts, like these two, or a clip to secure it on the shirt or a special coupler between LED and optical wire (for a hat). 

The second picture shows a specially made clicker that I would hold in my hand during the event to switch animation programs. It was pretty sketchy, I had a vest full of electronics, wires, batter and in my hand, I had a black clicker with one big button. ðŸ˜…

The initial idea was to print on fabric. You can see the scales test I did first. It worked well, but scaling it to a full tie length would be hard or even impossible. 

You can also see I was playing with the idea of enclosing LED inside the 3D part during the print. It is possible, but soldering would be a pain.

I've designed and printed a special rig that I used to glue all the cells to the fabric keeping consistent hexagonal spacing. In one of the photos, you can see me using the baking paper as an interface between my fingers, superglue, fabric and a cell. 

When all was glued in I've cut round holes for LEDs to come in.

As you can see I've designed and printed another rig to hold all the LEDs in place with identical spacing as on covers while I am gluing them in. Since addressable RGB LEDs are connected into a strip, I've left markings about direction. 

When everything was soldered in I've glued another (black) fabric on top (back) to hold everything in place.

The brains of the whole operation was a Teensy microcontroller. I specifically used that and not cheaper Arduino because I needed hardware to be able to perform FFT (fast Fourier transform). FFT is how you split sound waves into frequency bands, which gives you an equalizer visualisation (see below).

Unfortunately, the whole FFT music sensing got screwed. Music in the event was much louder than what I was testing at home. The result - sensor was saturated and it didn't produce the desired effect. But thankfully I had other patterns, like Matrix rain, fire and random colour flashing.
